I need my configurations to be fully synchronized with the Operative System ones.
Either if it is Linux, MacOS or Windows.
Priority:
1. Linux: Arch Linux, then Ubuntu
2. MacOS
3. Windows (consider we will use WSL anyways)
If I change something in this repository, it should reflect in the OS / kernel.
These changes should be executed via the .install.sh
